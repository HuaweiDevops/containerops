### The Dockyard's Story :)

The Dockyard is my startup project before joined Huawei in April 2015, and then I donated to Huawei company. Now the git repository in the Huawei organization in Github. The Dockyard is a combo included container registry and artifact repository. It is an important part of any DevOps process, even more in ContainerOps which is a container's implement of DevOps Orchestration.

The version of Dockyard in the ContainerOps repository is the minimal functions of Dockyard project, and we will continuous develop it as the next release. The repository in the Huawei organization is freezing for a while, and this version migrates to the repository finally in the feature.
